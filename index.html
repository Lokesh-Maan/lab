    <h2>What are Wildfires?</h2>
    <p>A wildfire, forest fire, or a bushfire is an unplanned, uncontrolled and unpredictable fire in an area of combustible vegetation.[1][2] Depending on the type of vegetation present, a wildfire may be more specifically identified as a bushfire (in Australia), desert fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, prairie fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.[3] Some natural forest ecosystems depend on wildfire.[4] Modern forest management often engages in prescribed burns to mitigate fire risk and promote natural forest cycles.</p>

    <h2>Latest News</h2>
	
    <p>Starting on January 7, 2025, an ongoing series of catastrophic wildfires have affected the Los Angeles metropolitan area and surrounding regions. The fires have been exacerbated by very low humidity, dry conditions, and hurricane-force Santa Ana winds that in some places have exceeded 80–100 miles per hour (130–160 km/h). As of January 10, the wildfires have killed 11 people,[3] forced nearly 180,000 more to evacuate, and destroyed or damaged more than 13,400 structures.</p>
